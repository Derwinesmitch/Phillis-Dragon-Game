# Dragon Island 🐉

> Using Antigravity to make a dragon themed game with my son.

A child-friendly top-down 2D game inspired by Stardew Valley and Dragon City. Designed for an 8-year-old audience with simple controls and non-violent gameplay.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

We chose this stack for rapid development, ease of sharing (web link), and performance on low-end devices (tablets/laptops).

- **Phaser 3**: Robust 2D game framework. Great for tile-based games and handling sprites/physics.
- **Vite**: Modern build tool for fast development and hot-reloading.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Standard web standard.
- **Assets**: 16-bit pixel art style (generated by AI, processed for transparency).
